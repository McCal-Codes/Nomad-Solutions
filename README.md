# Nomad Solutions — Burning Man RV Rentals

A minimal, SEO-first Next.js site for an RV rental service focused on Burning Man. The UI is mobile-first, desert-inspired, dark/light mode capable, and built to expand with real booking APIs.

## Structure

- `src/components`: Reusable UI elements (cards, pricing table, includes grid, gallery, theme controls, availability widget).
- `src/lib`: Data seeds for the fleet and availability API.
- `docs`: Project guide, TODOs, SEO checklist, and component reference.

## Getting started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
